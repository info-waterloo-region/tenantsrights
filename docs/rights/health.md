# Health & Safety

If there are health and safety issues in the building/appartment that is being rented. Contact the landlord in writing – _a work order or a demand letter_. Make sure to document: take pictures, write down dates, and concerns, record when you contacted the landlord, [By-Law](./by-law.md), etc.

If it is an “emergency” and you cannot reach the landlord, contact [Fire Prevention](./fireprevention.md) as appropriate.

## Immediate Hazard

Issues with sprinkler or electrical system, fire exits blocked, and (smoke) alarms not working.
- Contact [Fire Prevention](./fireprevention.md) if not resolved in 24 hours.

## Other concerns

Issues that come under minor obstructions to exits, damaged hall or stair lighting / emergency lighting, poor fitting or damaged doors / ceilings / walls.
-  Make sure that you have sent a written request to the property management. If the problem is not solved in two weeks contact [Fire Prevention](./fireprevention.md).
