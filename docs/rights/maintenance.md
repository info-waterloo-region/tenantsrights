# Maintenance & Repairs

If there are maintenance and repair issues in the building/appartment that is being rented. Contact the landlord in writing– a work order or a demand letter. Make sure to document: take pictures, write down dates and concerns, record when you contacted the landlord, By-Law, etc.

If it is an “emergency” and you cannot reach the landlord, contact [By-Law or Fire Prevention](./by-law.md) as appropriate.
