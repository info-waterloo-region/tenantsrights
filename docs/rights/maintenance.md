# Maintenance & Repairs

If there are maintenance and repair issues in the building/appartment that is being rented. Contact the landlord in writing– a work order or a demand letter. Make sure to document: take pictures, write down dates and concerns, record when you contacted the landlord, [By-Law](./by-law.md), etc.

If it is an “emergency” and you cannot reach the landlord, contact [By-Law or Fire Prevention](./by-law.md) as appropriate.

## "Essential" service

This covers hot water, heating, and sewage.
- Contact [By-law](./by-law.md) if not resolved in 24 hours.

## Not an "essential" service

Make sure that you have sent a written request to the property management. If the problem is not solved in two weeks contact city [By-Law](./by-law.md).

An inspector comes within a week in the case of a “non-essential” issue.

[By-Law](./by-law.md) will issue a repair order to be completed by the landlord within a minimum of 19 days. If the issue is not fixed within that time, [By-Law](./by-law.md) will contract someone to do the work or lay a charge against the property management.
