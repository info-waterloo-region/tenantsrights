# Tenant organisations

Many neighbourhoods have their own tenants groups to help empower each of them to help with advocacy, landlord issues, or housing problems. 

## R.E.N.T.

R.E.N.T. seeks to improve safety, security, and affordability of rental housing in the Waterloo region by educating and organizing tenants as well as advocating on behalf of their interests.

The organization believes that every tenant has a basic human right to shelter - safe, affordable, and secure. They encorage tenants to become knowledgeable and proactive concerning their rights, responsibilities, and current housing legislation. R.E.N.T. also encourages tenants to come together and form groups and association. Tenants Organizing Manual is a tool we share to support organizing of renters wherever they live.
